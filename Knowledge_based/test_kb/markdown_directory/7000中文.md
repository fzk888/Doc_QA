Two sets of master texts for the existing documents  for  this  project  are
centrally stored. The content of both sets is identical.
Team members in software development can  retain  some  documents  on  their
local machines. These should typically be copies of  the  master  text,  and
they should remain consistent with it. Any  necessary  modifications  should
first be made to the master text.
Developers only retain portions of the main text relevant to their work.
Managers should promptly revoke the old document when  a  new  one  replaces
it. They should also update the main text in real time  as  content  changes
to reflect the updates.
At the end of a project, documentation specialists should reclaim  documents
from developers.  Differences  found  between  documents  and  master  texts
should be addressed promptly, often due to delayed updates to the master.
In  software  development,  it  may  be  necessary   to   revise   completed
documentation, especially in large-scale projects. Any changes to  the  main
text must be  handled  with  great  care.  Before  making  modifications,  a
thorough assessment of the potential impact is essential,  and  the  process
should follow a strict sequence: proposal, review, scrutiny,  approval,  and
implementation.
